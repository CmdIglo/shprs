# Shell parser

## Shell parser CLI

This cli parses Shell scripts and checks if the syntax in the script is correct.
Built, because Shell is interpreted line by line, so that if there are errors in the script's syntax further down the script, the changes that have been made by the script in lines that come on the top of the script are made and that can cause serious damage to your system.
